# Insertion-Sort
C++ implementation of the Insertion sort algorithm

The insertion sort algorithm is used to sort a small set of numbers from greatest to least in a short amount of time

Time complexity is O(n^2). it is a stable sorting algorithm as it does not change the relative order of the array.It works well used for shorter input.
